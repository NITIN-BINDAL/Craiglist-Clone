# Craiglist-Clone

This is Craiglist clone with a much much sexier GUI .To see the website working just fork it and change the location in 'BASE_CRAIGLIST_URL' (in myapp/views.py) to your location or keep it as it is to just use it.Now search anything to buy or you want some services from other people or anything else  and Click submit .Your results are ready!!.

This website is made purely on Django.
Languages used ----> Python,CSS3,Html5

This time i have used Google Materialize in this rather than Bootstrap and it seems materialize is also pretty good.

Moreover there is database support aslo to see all the past searches user has searched for just go to /admin to see all the past searches.

Further we also have used Beautiful-Soup4 for scraping purposes.

I am keeping this website open-source so what are you waiting for? Fork and contribute in this and if your contributions are good i will be adding your name in credits list.
